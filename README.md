This site was created using the open weather API for the data and the unsplash API for the images. The idea is to get used to the interaction with APIs to populate information on your pages. This is the fourth project in the Microvese technical curriculum for JavaScript.

## Built With

- Javascript
- DOM
- Webpack
- API

## Live Demo

[Live Demo Link](https://raw.githack.com/mateomh/JS-weather-app/weather-app/dist/index.html)


### Usage

Everything you need to run the page is inside the **dist** folder of the project. Just copy the index.html and the main.js from this folder and open the index.html in you browser. Both files should remain in the same folder for it to work.
